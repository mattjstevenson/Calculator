# MacOS Calculator App - React

[React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)

#### The Live App:

[MacOS Calc App](https://determined-babbage-83ee06.netlify.com)

### Run:

```javascript
    npm install npm@latest -g

    npm start

    *outdated*
```

#### This application was one of the first I delved into to get some experience and essentially try to understand React, as a beginner. The app is simple, it's a close copy of the MacOS Calculator, styled appropriately and functioning similarly also - despite a few minor bugs. As most, undertaking building a Calc app was the first on my agenda due to its simplicity whilst also putting me through my paces with regards to performing calculations mathematically.
